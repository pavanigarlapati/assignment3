# Responsive Personal Portfolio Website

This is my responsive personal portfolio webpage built using **HTML + CSS only**.  
The goal of this project was to design a clean, responsive layout and use an **AI website-building tool** to accelerate development.

## 🚀 AI Tool Used
I used **Lovable.dev** to generate the initial template for my portfolio website.

Lovable provided the base structure of:
- Header layout  
- Hero section  
- Skills grid  
- Footer structure

## 🛠️ Manual Changes I Made
After generating the template using Lovable, I manually reviewed and improved the code as required:

### ✔ **1. Improved Responsiveness**
- Fixed layout issues on mobile screens  
- Made the skills section collapse into 1 column on mobile  
- Adjusted navigation spacing for tablet view  
- Ensured no horizontal scrolling on any device  

### ✔ **2. Customized the Design**
- Updated colors and spacing  
- Improved typography  
- Customized the hero section text  
- Re-styled the buttons  
- Cleaned unused CSS from Lovable’s code  

### ✔ **3. Organized Code Structure**
- Removed unnecessary inline styles  
- Cleaned comments auto-generated by AI  
- Separated CSS into `style.css`  
- Ensured semantic HTML structure

### **1. Header**
- My name / logo

### **2. Hero Section**
